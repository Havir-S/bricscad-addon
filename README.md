## Bricscad v17 personal addon

This is just a simple solution for an issue I've been having. It's impossible to perfectly remember 500+ names of blocks that I'm using for a project. Keeping a second project open just to search for 1 block that I can't find used to be the 'go to' solution, but I wanted to improve it even more with code.

### How it works

- Running `python main.py` in the terminal start's the program.
- Since it's not connected to BricsCad itself, it will appear as a separate window.
- By clicking any of the traffic signs images, the app mimics all the actions the user would have to perform in order to insert that specific block.

### Config
There is also a config file which is being read on every start of the program. It contains variables for the size and the position of the app's window.
